# courseulator: deal with a course report
Bart Massey 2024

This quick Python script tries to figure out the latest
offering of each of our PSU CS 410 "TOPIC" courses. The
input is an Excel spreadsheet.

Right now this is quite janky and barely works. Already
useful, though.

See `tiles.py` for a string-similarity measurement that has
been tuned for the use case.
